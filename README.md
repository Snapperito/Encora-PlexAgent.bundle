# Encora Plex Agent

This agent will scrape recording data from Encora, including downloading subtitles.
It will also fallback to using [XBMCnfoMoviesImporter](https://github.com/Bubba8291/XBMCnfoMoviesImporter.bundle/archive/master.zip) if no encora ID is found, so that NFO files (created with [NFOBuilder](https://github.com/pekempy/NFOBuilder)) can be used to set the data.

<sup>Thanks to [Bubba8291](https://github.com/Bubba8291) for working on the [Headshot Database](https://stagemedia.me) used for the agent.</sup>

_Please note: The Encora API is rate limited to 30 requests per minute by default. This means that scanning your full library make take time if you have a large amount of recordings in Plex.
The agent is configured to handle the rate limit and continue processing entries once the limit resets._
You will also require an API key for [StageMedia.me](https://stagemedia.me) so make sure to generate one over there, or you won't get headshots/posters pulled through.

### Instructions

- Download the entire repository ([click here](https://github.com/pekempy/Encora-PlexAgent.bundle/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)) and extract the folder inside
- Rename `Encora-PlexAgent.bundle-main` -> `Encora-PlexAgent.bundle`
- Move the `.bundle` folder to your Plugins Directory
  - By default, this will be:
    - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-ins`
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins`
    - Linux: `$PLEX_HOME/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins`
  - It should look like this:  
    ![Plugin Preview](src/plugins-folder.png)
- Create a library in Plex with `Encora` as the agent
- Populate your API Keys in the settings
    - Note: 
        The **Encora** API key you will have to request via a support request on the site.  
        The **StageMedia** API key is self-generated from your profile  
- Configure the naming of Plex items
  ![Plex Library](src/plex-library.png)
- In your Plex Settings, make sure you enable XBMCnfoMoviesImporter as a backup agent for Encora
  ![Agent Setting](src/plex-agent.png)
- Your media items should have `e-{id}` in the name e.g. `Murder Ballad {e-1118317}` **or** have an `.encora-{id}` file inside the folder e.g. `.encora-1118317`
- For non-Encora items, make sure you have an NFO created with [NFOBuilder](https://github.com/pekempy/NFOBuilder), and then `⋮` button -> `Match` -> `Auto Match` dropdown -> `XBMCnfoMoviesImporter`, that should then detect the NFO and pull the data from it.

#### Available Title Variables:

**Text:**
`{show}` - This is the show's name - e.g. `Hadestown`. Note, if a show has "Part 1" and "Part 2", these should be removed.  
`{tour}` - The name of the tour - e.g. `West End` or `Broadway`  
`{master}` - The name of who recorded the item

**Dates:**
`{date}` - e.g. `December 31, 2024`  
`{date_iso}` - e.g. `2024-12-31`  
`{date_usa}` - e.g. `12-31-2024`  
`{date_numeric}` - e.g. `31-12-2024`  
If the entry has a 'variant' it will be displayed as `(1)` at the end of the value e.g. `December 31, 2024 (3)`

If a show is missing a month / day, the `date replace character` in the library preferences can be set so for example you can have `xx-xx-2024` or `12-xx-2024` or even `2024-12-##` - any standard character can be used. Only the first one will be used so if you enter multiple letters here just the first gets used.

### Fixing missing posters / headshots

If posters or headshots are missing from your Plex after matching on Encora, then you will need to contribute to the [StageMedia.me database](https://stagemedia.me).
You can upload images there, and then press the `⋮` button, and `Refresh Metadata` in Plex, and you should now have headshots for those actors/posters for that show in your Plex.
This helps _everyone_ who uses this plugin, not just you!

You will need your own account for this site, so sign up and contribute what you can :)
